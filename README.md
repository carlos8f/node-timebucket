## timegroup

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/carlos8f/node-timegroup.png)](http://travis-ci.org/carlos8f/node-timegroup)

Group timestamps into timegroups, by applying a granularity to a discrete value

A **timegroup** is a type of
[time domain](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~rts/pubs/LNCS1399p406.pdf)
which combines a granularity identifier with a discrete value, and can
be stored as a compact string.

Timegroups are useful for grouping timestamps together using a particular
granularity (such as groups of 30 minutes), as an aid for graphing or
map/reduce-ing time-series data.

Also, timegroups can serve as a neutral format between which UNIX timestamps
(seconds before or after 1970), millisecond timestamps (as used in JavaScript),
and microsecond timestamps (such as those used in high-frequency trading
applications) can be converted, and stored in a complete way (with granularity
attached).

## Anatomy of a timegroup

A **timegroup** consists of:

1. (optional) an unsigned granularity multiplier (default: `1`)
2. a granularity identifier, i.e. `s` for seconds
3. a signed value, i.e. number of seconds, after or before epoch year (1970)

### Format examples

- `8h-491` - time (within 8 hours) of first moonwalk (`1969-07-21 02:56`)
- `y43` - the year 2013

## API

The `timegroup` module exports a single factory function. It supports the
following argument combinations:

- `timegroup()` - build timegroup with millisecond granularity applied to current date
- `timegroup(granularity)` - build from specific granularity (string identifier, see list below) applied to current date
- `timegroup(milliseconds)` - build from milliseconds since 1970
- `timegroup(granularity, value)` - build from specific granularity and value
- `timegroup(date)` - build from date object with millisecond granularity

### API examples

```js
var timegroup = require('timegroup');

// defaults to current milliseconds after unix epoch
console.log(timegroup());
// 'ms1369601120380'

// create a timegroup from implied granularity (milliseconds) and value
console.log(timegroup(1369601120380));
// 'ms1369601120380'

// create a timegroup from specific granularity (seconds) and value
console.log(timegroup('s', 1369601125));
// 's1369601125'

// convert to year granularity
console.log(timegroup().convert('y'));
// 'y43'

// create timegroup from current seconds after unix epoch, and add 5
console.log(timegroup('s').add(5));
// 's1369601125'

// create timegroup from date object
console.log(timegroup(new Date()));
// 'ms1369601120380'

// create timegroup from string representation
console.log(timegroup('y43'));
// 'y43'

// access granularity and value as properties
var t = timegroup();
console.log(t.granularity, t.value);
// 'ms' 1369601120380

// create timegroup with granularity multiplier
console.log(timegroup('30m'));
// '30m760894'

// convert with granularity multiplier
console.log(timegroup('y').convert('30m'));
// '30m753360'

```

## Granularity identifiers

- `Âµs` - microseconds
- `ms` - milliseconds
- `s` - seconds
- `m` - minutes
- `h` - hours
- `d` - days
- `w` - weeks
- `mo` - months
- `y` - years
